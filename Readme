**Verlet Particle System Simulation**

A real-time cloth and flag simulation using Verlet integration, implemented in Python with Pygame. The system models particles connected by distance constraints, supports user interaction, and includes wind effects to animate the cloth dynamically.

---

## Features

* **Verlet Integration** for stable particle motion.
* **Distance Constraints** to simulate springs between particles.
* **Cloth/Grid Generation**: Create a grid of particles, with top row fixed to simulate cloth hanging.
* **Wind Simulation**: Toggleable wind force affecting particles.
* **Interactive UI**: Main menu, buttons, and text rendering.
* **Configurable Parameters**: Frame rate, grid size, spacing, integration steps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Pygame library

Install Pygame via pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   ```

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/verlet-system.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/verlet-system.git)
cd verlet-system

````
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows
````

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   ```

pip install -r requirements.txt

````

## Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
````

* Use the main menu to start or exit the simulation.
* Press **W** to toggle wind on/off during the simulation.
* Click and drag particles to interact with the cloth.

## Controls

| Key / Mouse           | Action                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **W**                 | Toggle wind simulation               |
| **Left Mouse Button** | Select and drag individual particles |
| **ESC**               | Exit simulation or back to main menu |

---

## Configuration

Inside `main.py`, you can adjust:

* `FPS`: Simulation frame rate (default 200).
* `NUM_X`, `NUM_Y`: Grid dimensions for cloth particles.
* `spacing`: Particle spacing in pixels.
* `NUM_ITER`: Constraint solver iterations per frame.
* `delta_t`: Time step for Verlet integration.
